## Christopher Kapic's Public Notes Repository

Welcome to my notes repository. It is pretty straightforward: I (often, though not always) take notes in Latex. Sometimes, I wish I had access to my notes across multiple devices. Now, I could use something like [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/), and honestly, that makes a lot of sense, but I do not feel like setting it up, and using a Git repo is simple enough. This repo is public for reading, but I will not accept pull requests (though I do reserve the right to change my mind in the future on that).
